# Hello World Skill

This is the **simplest possible skill**. It demonstrates the minimum structure needed
for a working Gemini CLI agent skill.

## What This Skill Does

When a user sends a friendly greeting, respond with:
1. A warm greeting back
2. A fun fact about the current day
3. An offer to help with something

## Example Interaction

**User**: Hey there! 👋
**Agent**: Hello! Great to see you! 🎉 Did you know that today is a great day to learn
something new? What can I help you with?

## Why This Example Matters

This skill has:
- ✅ Valid YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`
- ✅ A clear markdown body with instructions
- ✅ No scripts, references, or other directories needed

**That's it!** A single `SKILL.md` is all you need for a working skill.
